# About me

I like to call myself data engineer. It is a way for me to mix my engineer degree in Physics with my degree in Biostatistics. I like to take a problem and to bring a practical solution. I like the machine learning approaches which I found very powerful and have high potential for solving practical challenges in data analysis. But I try to not forget that this is in fact re-branding of statistics methods. 

I yell at people who said "Statistics can be made to prove anything ...". Unfortunately, statistics are used much like a drunk man uses a lamppost: for support, not illumination. I invest a lot of time developing tools for data visualisation and try to communicate them. In my work, I try to convince clients and collaborators that more than 50% of a statistician job is actually to try to represent data ... and the modelling/inference part comes after.

Beside statistics, I believe that [wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) is one of the most *impressive* *collective* effort of the Humanity. I am a big fan of [github](https://github.com/). To ease the pressure, I like to do rock climbing, squash, yoga and running.

# Biography

I am a PhD student at Zurich University in the [applied statistics group](https://www.math.uzh.ch/as/). My research interests includes Multivariate and Bayesian analysis, systems epidemiology analysis, software developments and open research. After working several years in clinical research at different positions, I decided to enhance my education in Physics by doing a master degree in Biostatistics at Zurich University. Then I continue my education in statistics with a PhD in epidemiology and biostatistics. Beside my research activities, I am the maintainer of the statistical [consulting service](https://www.math.uzh.ch/as/index.php?id=consulting_as) for the members of the Faculty of Science of the UZH.
