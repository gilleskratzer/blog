      <description>The Google Ngram Viewer, started in December 2010, is an online search engine that returns the yearly relative frequency of a set of words, found in a selected printed sources, called corpus of books, between 1500 and 2016 (many language available). More specifically, it returns the relative frequency of the yearly ngram (continuous set of n words. For example, I is a 1-gram and I am is a 2-grams). This means that if you search for one word (called unigram), you get the percentage of this word to all the other word found in the corpus of books for a certain year.</description>

      <description>This post is highly inspired by this post from R-Bloggers and my previous post. Again the necessary code is available here.
As maintenair of an R package, it is always interesting to know if it is used and by whom? This post shows some plots to asses R package usage.
I started by a small review to list the similar other R packages. I found that bnlearn, deal and grbase are comparable to abn.</description>

      <description>This post is highly inspired by this post and this post. Here is the necessary code to produce those graphs (be aware that it is time and memory consuming!).
On June 10 2013, RStudio provides CRAN mirror logs download from 2012-10-01. Then it is possible to analyze this rich and huge amount of data. On an individual level, one can track the popularity of their (preferred package). Here one can track the number of download of the three most downloaded R packages.</description>
